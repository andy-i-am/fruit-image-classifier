UiA IKT902 course project — image recognition model using Teachable Machine (apples vs. tomatoes).
📖 About the project
This project was created as part of the IKT902 – Introduksjon til kunstig intelligens-teknologi course at the University of Agder (UiA).
The goal was to train a simple image recognition model using Google Teachable Machine to distinguish between apples and tomatoes.

🧠 Model details
	•	Platform: Teachable Machine (Image Project)
	•	Classes: Apple, Tomato
	•	Training images: Custom dataset (train/test split)
	•	Parameters: Epochs = 50, Batch size = 16, Learning rate = 0.001
	•	Accuracy: 100 % on the test set
	•	Export format: TensorFlow.js

🧪 Testing

The model was tested with images not seen during training (test set).
All images were correctly classified, showing clear visual separation between the two fruit types.
However, further tests with more varied data are recommended to check real-world robustness.
